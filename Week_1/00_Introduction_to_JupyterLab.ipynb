    "### Its not a **program** in the conventional sense of the term, in that it is usually executed in an interactive way. \n",
    "### All of the lectures, problem sets, tests, homeworks, in this class will be provided in the form of a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "### A Jupyter notebook can be opened in different Interactive Development Environments (IDE).  \n",
    "### My favorite is Visual Studio Code (VS Code) which I use for my research.  \n",
    "### Another widely used IDE is **Jupyter Lab** /**Jupyter Notebook**.  \n",
    "### They are kind of the same thing, and Jupyter Lab is the new and improved Jupyter Notebook, but not all features have made it over. \n",
    "### If you already took COGS/PSYC 10A and really loved Rstudio, or are familiar with Matlab you could use **Spyder** which has the same look and feel.  Just remmeber to install the Jupyter Notebook extension.  "
